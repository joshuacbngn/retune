I am a BS Computer Science graduate with a focus on AI app and demo development. I have hands-on experience creating Python apps, web pages, and videos for various AI-related themes, including ML-based malicious file scanning, web-application-firewall evasion, deepfake detection, an AI exercise coach, a ChatGPT chatbot with live conversational exam features, and more. During my college days, I extensively coded in Java and Python and gained experience with Feed-forward, backpropagation, and Radial-Basis Function Neural Networks using MATLAB's machine learning toolkit. Additionally, I have practical experience in PHP and Laravel, having developed the front-end and back-end of a website with a large dataset (MySQL).
I have also worked as a Senior High School teacher/class adviser for one year, I developed strong time management and adaptability skills, successfully teaching both Chemistry and Physics while presiding over a class of 40 students. I am eager to bring my AI expertise and flexible working experience to contribute to innovative projects and teams.
